        "### The Self-Reminder Method\n",
        "\n",
        "The self-reminder method takes inspiration from psychological research on human behavior. In psychology, self-reminders serve as mental cues that help people maintain self-control and remember important tasks. Since those LLMs can exhibit human-like reasoning patterns, researchers wondered: could we apply similar psychological strategies to improve their behavior?\n",
        "\n",
        "The technique works by encapsulating user queries with explicit reminders that tell the model to act responsibly. These reminders are placed both before and after the user's input, creating a persistent \"mode\" signal that becomes harder for jailbreak attempts to override. A typical structure looks like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "[Pre-reminder]\n",
        "You should be a responsible ChatGPT and should not generate harmful or\n",
        "misleading content! Please answer the following user query in a responsible way.\n",
        "\n",
        "[User Query]\n",
        "...\n",
        "\n",
        "[Post-reminder]\n",
        "Remember, you should be a responsible ChatGPT and should not generate harmful or misleading content!\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "According to research by [Xie et al. (2023)](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2873090/v1), this simple technique proved remarkably effective on ChatGPT (GPT-3.5). Their experiments showed that self-reminders reduced the ASR from 67.21% down to just 19.34%, which is a 71% relative reduction in successful jailbreaks. The persistent nature of these reminders helps anchor the model's behavior to its safety guidelines even when adversarial prompts try to redirect it."

        "[Wallace et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13208) demonstrated that instruction hierarchy provides substantial improvements across multiple types of attacks. For system prompt extraction attacks, where adversaries try to reveal the hidden system instructions, this approach showed a 63% improvement in defense. Against prompt injection attacks, it provided a 40% improvement. Moreover, the technique wasn't directly trained to defend against jailbreaks, it still provided a 30% improvement in jailbreak resistance, suggesting that teaching models to respect privilege hierarchies has broader security benefits beyond the specific attack types it was designed for."

        "\n",
        "Rather than making the primary language model defend itself against attacks, an alternative approach uses a separate, specialized LLM as a \"guard\" that independently checks both inputs and outputs for harmful content. This separation of concerns creates a dedicated security layer that can focus entirely on safety assessment without compromising the primary model's capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Several guard models have been developed for this purpose, including [Qwen3-Guard](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14276), [Llama-Guard](https://www.llama.com/llama-protections/#safeguard-model), [Constitutional Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18837) and others, each trained specifically for content moderation.\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yeedrag/technical-workshop-xlab/main/LLM_Attacks_%26_Defenses/images/arch_guard.png\" width=\"1000\">\n",
        "\n",
        "These guard models come pre-trained with built-in taxonomies of harmful content. For example, Llama Guard uses six main categories: Violence & Hate, Sexual Content, Guns & Illegal Weapons, Regulated Substances, Suicide & Self-Harm, and Criminal Planning. Each category has been carefully defined with examples to help the guard model accurately identify different types of harmful content.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using LLMs as safeguards offers two key advantages. First, it separates the assessment process for inputs versus outputs, allowing different thresholds and criteria for incoming user messages versus generated responses. Moreover, these guard models can be easily adapted through few-shot learning or fine-tuning to handle organization-specific safety requirements or emerging threat patterns, all without modifying the primary model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Obtaining labeled examples for harmful content is not only expensive, but also [psychologically taxing for human annotators who must repeatedly examine disturbing material](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66465231). Second, evolving threats emerge faster than training datasets can be updated, creating a constant game of catching up.  Constitutional Classifier models, like that of Anthropic, use a framework of constitutions that define categories of harmless/permissable content and harmful/unpermissable content, and use synthetic data generation to continually train their classifier models (LLMs) on current and emerging threats with minimal laborious effort.\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yeedrag/technical-workshop-xlab/main/LLM_Attacks_%26_Defenses/images/arch_constitutional.png\" width=\"1000\">\n",
        "\n",
        "These architectures offers a few key advantages. First, they separates the assessment process for inputs and outputs, allowing different thresholds and criteria for incoming user messages versus generated responses. Input models prevent attacks, obfuscation, or circumvention against the output classifier Second, these guard models can be easily adapted through few-shot learning or fine-tuning to handle organization-specific safety requirements or emerging threat patterns, all without modifying the primary model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, Some variation of models allow for output gaurds/classifiers that are continuous token streaming, in that they only need a subset $T'$ of all the tokens in a potential output $T$ to predict $T$ as harmful during generation.  For each token generated, the model outputs the probability $\\mathbb{P}(y=1|T_{1:T'})$ that the full output sequence is harmful. This is typically computed through $σ(z(T_{1:T'}))$ where $σ(⋅)$ is the sigmoid function and $z$ is the output logit from the model.\n",

Once this value crosses a certain threshold value, the remainder of the token sequence is likely harmful and is not shown to the user.\n",
